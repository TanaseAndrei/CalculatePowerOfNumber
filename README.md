# CalculatePowerOfNumber
A simple application that calculates the power of a number.
Has 2 frames, one where you input and one that shows your result.
In the first frame you can write the base and the exponent, or having a checkbox checked you can keep the exponent and change the base;
additionally you have a button that being pressed will generate the output in the second frame.


Note: the application is finished, the only remaining thing to do is to make it scalable. If you do not have the resolution 1920x1080
and the scale of 100%, the application will look muddy and the components will alter making it dirty.
